# Aviyel Invoice App (Ruslan's task to get a great job in Aviyel)
This app consists of two parts: frontend(React) and backend(django)

1.  Frontend
    There are so many choices for frontend stack (including Vanila JS, Aviyel team recommended).
    OF COURES, I can complete this project with VanilaJS, traditional ECMAScript programming, and I understood your recommendation is
    to see core knowledge of javascript language.
    I agree with your opinion, but to be sure to implement all functionalities completely and perfectly in short period, I've made up my mind to use ReactJs for your task.
    I think the ReactJS is the nearest javascript frameworkt to VanilaJS.
    
2.  Backend
